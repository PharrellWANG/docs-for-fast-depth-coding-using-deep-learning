Fast Depth Coding Using Deep Learning
=====================================

**Fast Depth Coding Using Deep Learning** is the thesis topic.
The details of the implementation are documented here for reference.

This documentation is organized into a couple sections:

* :ref:`proposed-algorithm`
* :ref:`data-processing`
* :ref:`model-training`
* :ref:`model-testing`
* :ref:`codec-integration`
* :ref:`quick-memo`
* :ref:`simulation-results`
* :ref:`references`
