Metrics HOW-TO
==============

PSNR and bitrate are two important metrics to obtain the BDBR, BDPSNR which
are two common criteria for measuring the average PSNR differences between
RD-curves.

How to obtain the PSNR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Firstly, we need to render the views for both baseline and proposed algorithm
for obtaining synthesized views.

After the synthesized views will be obtained, we use them to calculate the PSNR.
