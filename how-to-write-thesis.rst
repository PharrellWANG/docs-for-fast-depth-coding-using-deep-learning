How to write abstract
---------------------

See [REF3]_ for the original guidance. Here I make a summary:

What is an Abstract
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. It is a summary of the whole thesis.

2. It presents all the major elements of your work in a highly condensed form.

3. It often functions, together with the thesis title, as a stand-alone text.

4. In addition to prepare the reader for the thesis, it must be capable of substituting for the whole thesis when there is insufficient time and space for the full text.

Size and Structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. PolyU requirements for MSc thesis is 200 to 500 words for abstract.

2. Currently, the maximum sizes for abstracts submitted to Canada's National Archive are 150 words (Masters thesis) and 350 words (Doctoral dissertation).

3. To preserve visual coherence, you may wish to limit the abstract for your doctoral dissertation to one double-spaced page, about 280 words.

4. The structure of the abstract should mirror the structure of the whole thesis, and should represent all its major elements.

5. For example, if your thesis has five chapters (introduction, literature review, methodology, results, conclusion), there should be one or more sentences assigned to summarize each chapter.

6. Clearly Specify Your Research Questions

Don't Forget the Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. The most common error in abstracts is failure to present results.

2. The primary function of your thesis (and by extension your abstract) is not to tell readers what you did, it is to tell them what you discovered.

3. Approximately the last half of the abstract should be dedicated to summarizing and interpreting your results.
